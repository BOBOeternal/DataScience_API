# DataScience

The objective is to collect a dataset from a public Web API and then use Python to prepare, analyse, and derive insights from the collected data. 
Here I choose U.S. Energy Information Administration(https://www.eia.gov/opendata/) to anaylyse the monthly eletricity selling data for 16 years(2006-2021) in 4 states of the US. 
The data include price(cents per kilowatthour), revenue(million dollars), sales(million kilowatthours, the electricity price differs from its sector, there are industrial(IND), residential(RES), commercial(COM) and all sectors(ALL) and the 4 states are Califronia(CA), Florida(FL), Illinois(IL) and Minnosota(MN).

### Task 1: Data Collection
- Retrieval of sufficient data for analysis from your selected web API.
- Saving dataset in an appropriate format.

### Task 2: Data Preparation and Analysis
- Loading dataset in an appropriate representation.
- Data pre-processing, including cleaning, filtering, and transformation of the data before analysis.
- Characterisation, summarisation, and analysis of the collected data.
- Includes use of visualisations and tables where appropriate.
- Explanation and interpretation of the analysis and the results.

### Task 3: Discussion and Conclusion
- Discuss any challenges faced in collecting data.
- Summarise the key insights gained from your analysis of the data.
- Suggest ideas for further analysis.
